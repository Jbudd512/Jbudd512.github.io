# Pig Latin Activity

[ Oday ouyay eakspay igpay atinlay? ](http://www.wikihow.com/Speak-Pig-Latin)

In this activity we're going to create an application that translates regular English words into Pig Latin. We'll use a React application as a template to run the code that we are going to write for Pig Latin.

### Rules of Pig Latin
- For words beginning with a vowel, add "way" to the end.
- For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and add "ay".
- If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!
- "y" is treated like a vowel in appropriate circumstances.

There are many [ examples ](http://funtranslations.com/pig-latin) of Pig Latin translators out there on the Internet to give you inspiration.
